We have two version of our code.
1-CoarseFreqTrans_SingleTime.m
2-CoarseFreqTrans_MultipleTimes.m

1-CoarseFreqTrans_SingleTime.m: Calculates Normalized Symbol Error Rate for one time for given freuency offset. Plots all the figures on everye step that given in presentation slide.

2-CoarseFreqTrans_MultipleTimes.m: This version plots Normalized Symbol Error rate for given band of frequencies. Also, calculates error per offset for trial times. All the frequency offset band and trial time can be adjusted.

Since the code is based on functions of the book, it works in matlab files folder provided by the book.
